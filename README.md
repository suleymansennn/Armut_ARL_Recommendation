# Business Problem

Armut, Turkey's largest online service platform, brings together service providers and those who want to receive services. It allows easy access to services such as cleaning, repair, and transportation with just a few clicks on a computer or smartphone. A product recommendation system is to be created using Association Rule Learning with the data set containing users who received the service and the categories and services they received.

# Features

- UserID: Customer ID
- ServiceId: There are anonymized services for each category. (For example, couch cleaning service under the Cleaning category) A ServiceId can be found under different categories and represents different services under different categories. (For example, service with CategoryId 7 and ServiceId 4 is carpet cleaning, while service with CategoryId 2 and ServiceId 4 is furniture assembly.
- CategoryID: These are anonymized categories. (For example: Cleaning, transportation, repair categories)
- CreateDate: The date when the service was purchased.
